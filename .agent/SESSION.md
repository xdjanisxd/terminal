## Current state

The SGR indexed-color M2 slice is complete.

Implemented:

* bounded screen/cell/cursor model
* terminal and input mode models
* `TerminalState` semantic boundary
* printable ASCII terminal semantics
* CR, LF, BS
* delayed auto-wrap and bounded in-screen scrolling
* incremental project-owned `TerminalParser`
* private `vte` integration
* chunk-safe parser state and resumable semantic errors
* typed relative and absolute cursor movement through `TerminalState`
* typed display/line erase directions through `TerminalState`
* private CSI translation for CUU/CUD/CUF/CUB, CUP/HVP, CHA/VPA, ED, and EL
* private CSI mode translation for standard IRM and DEC-private DECAWM/DECTCEM
* parser-controlled insert/replace output and delayed-wrap cancellation through existing `TerminalState` semantics
* terminal-owned mutable horizontal tab stops with conventional eight-column defaults
* bounded HT movement, HTS, and current/all TBC through `TerminalState`
* explicit tab-stop resize and reset behavior
* typed current rendition for intensity, italic, underline, inverse, foreground, and background
* new printable cells snapshot current rendition without retroactively changing existing cells
* SGR reset, style set/clear, ANSI standard/bright colors, and per-channel defaults through `TerminalState`
* ordered SGR parameter handling with bare/empty reset behavior and safe unsupported-parameter no-ops
* semicolon-form `38;5;n` and `48;5;n` indexed colors across the full 0..=255 range
* bounded logical extended-color groups that prevent malformed, truecolor, or unknown-selector payloads from leaking into unrelated SGR operations

`terminal-core` currently depends only on `vte`, with default features disabled.

## Validation

Local required Cargo gates pass on `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

Current terminal-core coverage includes 143 unit/integration tests plus ownership doctests.

Structural Graphify data refreshed locally to 484 nodes and 627 edges. Semantic enrichment was unavailable because no supported LLM API key is configured.

Remote CI has not run for this unpushed slice and remains the merge gate.

## Important limitations

* Printable content is currently ASCII U+0020..U+007E only.
* CSI mode support is intentionally limited to standard IRM and DEC-private DECAWM/DECTCEM; all other mode identifiers remain no-ops.
* Horizontal tabs are cursor-only: they do not write tab characters or spaces into cells. HT cancels delayed wrap and remains on the final column when no later stop exists.
* SGR supports reset, bold, italic, underline, inverse, ANSI 16 colors, semicolon-form indexed foreground/background colors, and per-channel defaults. Truecolor, colon color forms, and additional styles remain deferred.
* Additional scrolling behavior, terminal replies, and remaining modes are not implemented yet.
* Unicode combining/wide-cell behavior is deferred.
* No PTY, renderer, scrollback, alternate screen, or terminal replies exist yet.
* Resize still uses top-left preservation with no line reflow.

See:

* ADR-0004 for parser ownership
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for terminal-core boundaries
* `docs/ROADMAP.md` for milestone state

## Next

1. Add a narrow full-screen SU/SD scroll-control slice through `TerminalState`, with bounded counts and no scrolling regions or scrollback.
