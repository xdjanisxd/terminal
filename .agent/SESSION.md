## Current state

The parser mode-dispatch M2 slice is complete.

Implemented:

* bounded screen/cell/cursor model
* terminal and input mode models
* `TerminalState` semantic boundary
* printable ASCII terminal semantics
* CR, LF, BS
* delayed auto-wrap and bounded in-screen scrolling
* incremental project-owned `TerminalParser`
* private `vte` integration
* chunk-safe parser state and resumable semantic errors
* typed relative and absolute cursor movement through `TerminalState`
* typed display/line erase directions through `TerminalState`
* private CSI translation for CUU/CUD/CUF/CUB, CUP/HVP, CHA/VPA, ED, and EL
* private CSI mode translation for standard IRM and DEC-private DECAWM/DECTCEM
* parser-controlled insert/replace output and delayed-wrap cancellation through existing `TerminalState` semantics

`terminal-core` currently depends only on `vte`, with default features disabled.

## Validation

Local required Cargo gates pass on `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

Current terminal-core coverage includes 103 unit/integration tests plus ownership doctests.

Authenticated CI passes on all six configured Windows, Linux, and macOS x86_64/ARM64 runners.

## Important limitations

* Printable content is currently ASCII U+0020..U+007E only.
* CSI mode support is intentionally limited to standard IRM and DEC-private DECAWM/DECTCEM; all other mode identifiers remain no-ops.
* SGR, additional scrolling behavior, terminal replies, and remaining modes are not implemented yet.
* Unicode combining/wide-cell behavior is deferred.
* No PTY, renderer, scrollback, alternate screen, or terminal replies exist yet.
* Resize still uses top-left preservation with no line reflow.

See:

* ADR-0004 for parser ownership
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for terminal-core boundaries
* `docs/ROADMAP.md` for milestone state

## Next

1. Add horizontal-tab behavior with terminal-owned mutable tab stops, including default stops and resize/reset behavior.
